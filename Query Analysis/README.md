# Analysis of executed queries in cypher, including Stored Procedures 

We have performed the analysis of our queries by storing them in the file **query_data.csv** and analysing 
them both in Python and R and you will find them in the files **Query_analysis_python.ipynb** and **Query_analysis_r.R** respectively.

## For analysis in R
Open the **Query_analysis_r.R** in RStudio and run the code line by line. You can also select everything and click "Source".
