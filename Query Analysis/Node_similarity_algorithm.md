## Node Similarity Algorithm
Node similarity algorithm compares two nodes based on their shared nodes. Two nodes are considered similar if they share many of the same neighbors. Node Similarity computes pair-wise similarities based on the Jaccard metric, also known as the Jaccard Similarity Score.


The formula to find the Index is:

Jaccard Index = (the number in both sets) / (the number in either set) * 100

The same formula in notation is:
J(X,Y) = |X∩Y| / |X∪Y|
