# Subgraphing

Our dataset is essentially a big network of multiple connected nodes and relationships. Running Cypher queries on the whole network costs a lot of resources and time. Subgraphing is way to narrow down and focus on a small portion of the whole dataset. A local network of some connected nodes is an example of a subgraph.

## Subgraphing in Neo4j

Neo4j contains a built-in library called the Graph Data Science (GDS) Library.
